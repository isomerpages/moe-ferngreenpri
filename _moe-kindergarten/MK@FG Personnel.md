# MK@FG Personnel


#### **Center Heads**


<img src="/images/Mrs%20Elfin%20Loh.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> I found my passion to teach after becoming a new mum nineteen years ago. This led me to start my own multiple awards-winning childcare.  Subsequently, I served as a Principal of a MindChamps PreSchool before joining MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green in December 2021.

Throughout the years with the constant drive to learn, I attained various professional qualifications such as Certificate in Western Art (Acrylic and Oil Painting); teaching Certificates to conduct Music & Movement, Speech & Drama and Creative Writing; Diploma in Pre-School Education-Teaching & Leadership; Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Care and Education, and a Masters Degree in Community Leadership and Social Development. I am also a Certified TetraMap Facilitator.

I believe every child has the potential to learn and will learn best in a nurturing environment with activities that are fun and stimulating. I am grateful to work alongside a team of like-minded educators in MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green. Together with the support from parents, we strive to give every child a strong start.

I rose from being a Senior Teacher to a Lead-Mentor Teacher before being appointed as Principal when the centre expanded their operations in 2018. In October 2020, I joined the Ministry of Education and was appointed the Deputy Centre Head for MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green Primary.  
  
I believe that every child is unique with their own individual strength. Children gain knowledge from interacting with people and things around them. As educators, we have the responsibility to scaffold learning in an environment that is warm and inviting which also helps to promote self-discovery and foster the children’s natural sense of curiosity. The African proverb,  “It takes a whole village to raise a child”,  resonates with me. Having a strong home-school partnership is important to allow our children to blossom in a supportive and safe environment, and reach their full potential.
