<img src="/images/Mrs%20Elfin%20Loh.jpg" style="width:200px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> I found my passion to teach after becoming a new mum nineteen years ago. This led me to start my own multiple awards-winning childcare.  Subsequently, I served as a Principal of a MindChamps PreSchool before joining MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green in December 2021.

Throughout the years with the constant drive to learn, I attained various professional qualifications such as Certificate in Western Art (Acrylic and Oil Painting); teaching Certificates to conduct Music & Movement, Speech & Drama and Creative Writing; Diploma in Pre-School Education-Teaching & Leadership; Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Care and Education, and a Masters Degree in Community Leadership and Social Development. I am also a Certified TetraMap Facilitator.

I believe every child has the potential to learn and will learn best in a nurturing environment with activities that are fun and stimulating. I am grateful to work alongside a team of like-minded educators in MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green. Together with the support from parents, we strive to give every child a strong start.
