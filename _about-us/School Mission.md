<h4>To Nurture <strong>Talents</strong>,</h4>
<h4><strong>Passion for Learning</strong>,</h4>
<h4><strong>Sense of Empathy </strong>and </h4>
<h4><strong>Spirit of Adventure</strong></h4>
<p>To do this would require the stakeholders of the Fern Green Kampong to
work in concert, to take a village approach to nurturing and celebrating
all talents and achievements as well as to commit to an inquiry approach
to teaching and learning to keep that curiosity alive and to help our children
appreciate diversity and find joy in learning.</p>
