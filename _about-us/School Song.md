Note: School Song audio requires own Youtube/Vimeo.


We are the seedlings <br>
With potential for growth <br>
Together here in Fern Green <br>
A place we call our home

For we are taught to give it our best <br>
To be kind and to learn with zest <br>
Our school is the garden <br>
Where our wings can unfold

<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
We are bright <br>
We are bold <br>
Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old <br>
Serve with pride <br>
Serve with joy <br>
Bringing glory to our school

Learning is joyful and we will never ever stop <br>
We are bright <br>
We are bold <br>
Fern Green Primary School

(Repeat Chorus)

We are bright <br>
We are bold <br>
Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old <br>
Serve with pride <br>
Serve with joy <br>
Bringing glory to our school

Learning is joyful and we will never ever stop <br>
We are bright <br>
We are bold <br>
Fern Green Primary School

(Repeat Verse)

We are bright <br>
We are bold <br>
Fern Green Primary School
