In a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, Isaac Newton made his most famous statement: “If I have seen further, it is by standing&nbsp;on the shoulders of giants.” Pioneering work is never easy and entails dedication, hard work and a strong sense of purpose.&nbsp; The founding principal, Mrs May Tang, envisioned students of Fern Green to be “<b>reflective inquirers, aspiring advocates and steadfast leaders”</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fern Green team and I will honour her legacy and continue to build on the strong foundation laid by Mrs Tang and the pioneer team to achieve our vision.  

At Fern Green, we place the student in the centre of what we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that all children&nbsp;are born unique with inherent personalities, preferences, innate strengths and capacity to grow and develop.&nbsp; We seek to illuminate every student’s strength and talent and to ignite in them the passion for learning and discover their purpose to serve others.&nbsp;&nbsp;The OECD Learning Compass 2030 has identified three transformative competencies that students need to be future-ready, contribute to and thrive in an increasingly complex world.&nbsp; The transformative competencies are:

a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Creating new value</u>

This means innovating to shape better lives.&nbsp; Through cultivating the&nbsp;<b>habits of reflection and inquiry</b>, our students learn to challenge the status quo and try to think out of the box for new solutions.

b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Reconciling tensions and dilemmas</u>

<b>Anchoring them in sound values</b>&nbsp;such as respect, care and resilience, students learn to empathize, consider opposing viewpoints and build sound arguments amidst uncertainty and complexity.

c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Taking responsibility</u>

Students learn to be&nbsp;<b>responsible leaders</b>&nbsp;who advocate for causes that will make a positive difference to Singapore and the world.

All children need caring adults to guide and support them.&nbsp; By partnering closely with parents and partners, and coordinating effort on many levels, we give all Fern Green students the roots (sound values, right attitudes and dispositions, stable, joyful and stimulating learning environments) and wings (future-ready transformative competencies) to fly.&nbsp; Let’s work hand in hand to help all our Fern Green students take flight.
