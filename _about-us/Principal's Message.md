Our school vision ‘Reflective Inquirers, Aspiring Advocates, Steadfast Leaders’ encapsulates the essence of what we hope all our Fern Green students will be.</p><p><strong>Reflective Inquirers:</strong> As reflective inquirers, students are encouraged to engage in thoughtful and careful consideration of their thoughts, actions and experiences and the world around them. They should ask questions, seek answers, and explore. They are guided to learn from experiences and seek improvements.&nbsp; Many of our students’ aspirations may begin as questions, and it is through their curiosity and reflection that they will embark on their unique paths to discover their aspirations.</p><p><strong>Aspiring Advocates: </strong>The term "advocate" implies taking a stand, speaking up for what one believes in, and striving to make the world a better place. We believe every Fern Green student has the potential to be an advocate for positive changes. &nbsp;Their aspirations may revolve around making a positive difference in their schoolmates’ lives and even society. &nbsp;Our role is to equip them with the character, mindset, knowledge, skills and courage to pursue those noble aspirations.</p><p><strong>Steadfast Leaders: </strong>Leadership is not about a title; it is about actions and influence. We call upon our students to become steadfast leaders – to be upstanding individuals who role model the way, inspire others, and effect positive changes.</p><p>Some of our students already have clear dreams and aspirations, while others may be unsure, and we tell them that it is fine.&nbsp; Their aspirations are like seeds planted in their hearts. It is okay if they have not fully sprouted yet but they will with time and care.</p><p>Fern Green seeks to work hand in hand with our students’ families, our partners and key stakeholders like our Parent Support Group and School Advisory Committee to provide the nurturing environment in our students’ journey of self-discovery.&nbsp; The journey of self-discovery and growth will enable our students to have greater understanding of their strengths, unique talents and interests for them to achieve their aspirations.</p><p>On behalf of my colleagues in Fern Green, we would like to express our deepest appreciation to our parents and partners for your strong support and we wish everyone a wonderful year ahead.</p><p>Warm Regards,</p><p>Ms Kong Yee Loon</p>
