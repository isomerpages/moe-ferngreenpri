<p><strong>Re-envisioning Our Future Together</strong>
</p>
<p>As Fern Green Primary School celebrates its 7th year in 2024, we take
this opportunity to reflect on our journey, marked by the graduation of
two cohorts of students, and to chart a refreshed direction for the years
ahead. &nbsp;This initiative was informed by an in-depth analysis of educational
trends, emerging national imperatives, and the evolving complexities of
the world of work and society. Through surveys, discussions, and staff
retreats, we gathered invaluable perspectives from FGians, staff, parents,
and partners, ensuring that our refreshed vision, mission, and values reflect
our shared aspirations.</p>
