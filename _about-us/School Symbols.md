<p>The leaves and hand depict the school’s belief in nurturing care and talents,
and its commitment to an inquiry approach to teaching and learning, and
care for the environment.&nbsp;They also form the letter, ‘F’ , which represents
‘Fern Green’.</p>
<h3><strong>School Song</strong></h3>
<p><em>Composed by: Jake Goh </em>
<br><em>Lyrics by: Jake Goh &amp; Staff of FGPS (2019)</em>
</p>
<p>We are the seedlings
<br>With potential for growth
<br>Together here in Fern Green
<br>A place we call our home</p>
<p>For we are taught to give it our best
<br>To be kind and to learn with zest
<br>Our school is the garden
<br>Where our wings can unfold</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong> 
<br>We are bright
<br>We are bold
<br>Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old
<br>Serve with pride
<br>Serve with joy
<br>Bringing glory to our school</p>
<p>Learning is joyful and we will&nbsp;never ever stop
<br>We are bright
<br>We are bold
<br>Fern Green Primary School</p>
<p>(Repeat Chorus)</p>
<p>We are bright
<br>We are bold
<br>Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old
<br>Serve with pride
<br>Serve with joy
<br>Bringing glory to our school</p>
<p>Learning is joyful and we will&nbsp;never ever stop
<br>We are bright
<br>We are bold
<br>Fern Green Primary School</p>
<p>(Repeat Verse)</p>
<p>We are bright
<br>We are bold
<br>Fern Green Primary School</p>
