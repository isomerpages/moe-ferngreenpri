<h2><strong>School Philosophy</strong></h2>
<p>Fern Green Primary School is designed as a school within a garden. Sited
within an oasis of greenery, the school environment beckons Students into
its fold to partake in exciting learning activities that are in store for
all learners.</p>
<p>The school believes that effective learning takes place when learner needs
drive lesson designs. We believe that each child is active and inquisitive
and wants to explore. As our children make the transition from kindergarten,
we would like to keep their innate curiosity alive and nurture them into
well-rounded, passionate, and curious lifelong learners.</p>
<p>Our instructional approaches begin with&nbsp;<strong>Inquiry</strong>.
Through the use of thought-provoking questions, we would like to spark
our students' curiosity and inspire in them a genuine need to learn so
that they care about the outcome of their investigations. Underpinning
the design of Fern Green's academic curriculum and co-curriculum is our
school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Innovation,
Care and Harmony.</p>
<p>The school would leverage School-Home-Community Partnership to avail our
children of a holistic learning experience. We hope to work closely with
Parents to reinforce values taught as well as foster our children's motivation
to learn and ask questions and encourage them to pursue what they love.</p>
