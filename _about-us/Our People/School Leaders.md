I went on to serve as Vice-Principal of Princess Elizabeth Primary School in September 2013 and was appointed Vice-Principal Designate of Fern Green Primary School on 20 March 2017.<br>Having learnt with the children and worked alongside parents for some time, I believe that having a positive outlook, a zest for life and quality relationships with others are critical in shaping one’s confidence and empowering one to dream and aspire. I also believe in building a strong tripartite relationship between the child, home and school in laying the necessary foundation for resilience building to meet the challenges of the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/School%20Leaders/Mdm%20Quek%20Hwee%20Peng%20Andrea.jpg"></div><p><br><strong>Vice-Principal <br>(Administration)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>I started my career with the Ministry of Education in MOEHQ before joining Guangyang Primary School as Administration Manager.

We need to leverage on our students’ strengths to help them achieve their personal best. By providing our students with a supportive and caring learning environment both in school and at home, it will help to create engaging and fulfilling experiences for them that will ignite their interest and motivation in learning and cultivate good values which they will uphold in their lives ahead.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green</h3><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/MK@Fern Green/Ms_Nur_Asyurah_Binte_Mohd_Roslan.jpg"></div><p><strong>Centre Head</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>I began my career in the Early Childhood industry as an English teacher in a local kindergarten for 3 years before joining a private Montessori childcare for 8 years. I rose from being a Senior Teacher to a Lead-Mentor Teacher before being appointed as Principal when the centre expanded their operations in 2018. In October 2020, I joined the Ministry of Education and was appointed the Deputy Centre Head for MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green Primary.<br><br>I believe that every child is unique with their own individual strength. Children gain knowledge from interacting with people and things around them. As educators, we have the responsibility to scaffold learning in an environment that is warm and inviting which also helps to promote self-discovery and foster the children’s natural sense of curiosity. The African proverb, “It takes a whole village to raise a child”, resonates with me. Having a strong home-school partnership is important to allow our children to blossom in a supportive and safe environment, and reach their full potential.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
