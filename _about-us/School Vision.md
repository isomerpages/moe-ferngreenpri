<p>“Ferns have existed since the prehistoric age.&nbsp;Having survived over
360-million years of evolution, they are still among the most beautiful
and resilient foliage plants. They are thought to be largely specialists
in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental
factors limit the success of flowering plants.&nbsp;The unusual spawning
methods of ferns hint at their resilience.&nbsp;One of the reasons ferns
are so successful and occupy such diverse regions of the globe is their
ability to reproduce in multiple ways. Ferns are remarkably adaptable.”</p>
<p>It is in similar light that we at Fern Green aspire for our children to
grow up to be as resilient as ferns, live life like a marathon rather than
a sprint, develop the passion for giving and perseverance for long-term
goals, pick themselves up every time they fall, and to have the courage
to explore and see failures as opportunities for learning to be a better
version of their former selves</p>
