“Ferns have existed since the prehistoric age. Having survived over 360-million years of evolution, they are still among the most beautiful and resilient foliage plants. They are thought to be largely specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of flowering plants. The unusual spawning methods of ferns hint at their resilience. One of the reasons ferns are so successful and occupy such diverse regions of the globe is their ability to reproduce in multiple ways. Ferns are remarkably adaptable.”

It is in similar light that we at Fern Green aspire for our children to grow up to be as resilient as ferns, live life like a marathon rather than a sprint, develop the passion for giving and perseverance for long-term goals, pick themselves up every time they fall, and to have the courage to explore and see failures as opportunities for learning to be a better version of their former selves
