    <td class="tg-0lax">I began my teaching career as an English Language, Mathematics and Social Studies teacher at Mayflower Primary School. After serving as Head of Department for Information and Communications Technology (ICT), I was appointed Vice-Principal in 2010 in the same school. I went on to serve as Vice-Principal of Princess Elizabeth Primary School in September 2013 and was appointed Vice-Principal Designate of Fern Green Primary School on 20 March 2017.<br>Having learnt with the children and worked alongside parents for some time, I believe that having a positive outlook, a zest for life and quality relationships with others are critical in shaping one’s confidence and empowering one to dream and aspire. I also believe in building a strong tripartite relationship between the child, home and school in laying the necessary foundation for resilience building to meet the challenges of the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment.</td>

    <td class="tg-0lax"><br><span style="color:inherit;background-color:transparent">My passion for teaching has led me to make a career change and I began my new path as a teacher in Tampines Primary School. I was then appointed as Head of Department for Student Well-Being in the same school before I joined MOE HQ as Head for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) in the Primary Curriculum unit. I returned to school and took on the role of Head of Department for CCE in Punggol Green Primary. I was appointed Vice-Principal of Fern Green Primary in December 2020.</span><br><br><span style="color:inherit;background-color:transparent">I believe that each and every child has their individual strengths and talents. Coupled with the right attitude to learn and the courage to face challenges, our children can succeed in everything they set out to do. To prepare them to be future-ready, we need to encourage them to think critically as individuals and as a collaborative group to make informed decisions by considering different ideas and perspectives. Decisions made will be guided by sound values and responsibilities to their family, friends, school and the nation. </span><br></td>

I was appointed Vice-Principal (Administration) in the same school in 2013 before moving on to serve as Vice-Principal (Administration) in Fern Green Primary School in Dec 2018.<br><br>I believe that each child is unique and each comes with his/her own innate abilities. We need to leverage on our students’ strengths to help them achieve their personal best. By providing our students with a supportive and caring learning environment both in school and at home, it will help to create engaging and fulfilling experiences for them that will ignite their interest and motivation in learning and cultivate good values which they will uphold in their lives ahead.</td>

    <th class="tg-0lax"><br>I found my passion to teach after becoming a new mum nineteen years ago. This led me to start my own multiple awards-winning childcare.  Subsequently, I served as a Principal of a MindChamps PreSchool before joining MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green in December 2021. <br><span style="color:inherit;background-color:transparent">Throughout the years with the constant drive to learn, I attained various professional qualifications such as Certificate in Western Art (Acrylic and Oil Painting); teaching Certificates to conduct Music &amp; Movement, Speech &amp; Drama and Creative Writing; Diploma in Pre-School Education-Teaching &amp; Leadership; Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Care and Education, and a Masters Degree in Community Leadership and Social Development. I am also a Certified TetraMap Facilitator.</span><br>I believe every child has the potential to learn and will learn best in a nurturing environment with activities that are fun and stimulating. I am grateful to work alongside a team of like-minded educators in MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green. Together with the support from parents, we strive to give every child a strong start.</th>

    <td class="tg-ktyi"><span style="color:#000;background-color:#FFF">I began my career in the Early Childhood industry as an English teacher in a local kindergarten for 3 years before joining a private Montessori childcare for 8 years. I rose from being a Senior Teacher to a Lead-Mentor Teacher before being appointed as Principal when the centre expanded their operations in 2018. In October 2020, I joined the Ministry of Education and was appointed the Deputy Centre Head for MOE Kindergarten @ Fern Green Primary.</span><br><br><span style="color:#000;background-color:#FFF">I believe that every child is unique with their own individual strength. Children gain knowledge from interacting with people and things around them. As educators, we have the responsibility to scaffold learning in an environment that is warm and inviting which also helps to promote self-discovery and foster the children’s natural sense of curiosity. The African proverb,  “It takes a whole village to raise a child”,  resonates with me. Having a strong home-school partnership is important to allow our children to blossom in a supportive and safe environment, and reach their full potential.</span> </td>
