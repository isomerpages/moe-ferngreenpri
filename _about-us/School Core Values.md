# **Our Core Values**



### **Respect**  
Your child demonstrates respect when he believes in his own self-worth and the intrinsic worth of all people.

### **Responsibility**  
Your child is responsible if he recognises that he has a duty to himself, his family, community, nation and the world, and fulfils his responsibilities with love and commitment.
