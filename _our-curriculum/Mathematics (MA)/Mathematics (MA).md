<b>Introduction</b>

Mathematics is important for every child in every education system.&nbsp; The principle aim of our Math curriculum is to equip young learners with a strong subject foundation and confidence in preparation for a high-quality, challenging and accessible education in the long term. Therefore, the main aspiration we have is to ensure that all students will achieve a level of mastery in numeracy, thus allowing them to function successfully in future life and careers. As for those who have the passion, dedication and ability, they will have every opportunity along with the necessary support to pursue mathematics to the highest possible level.
