# **Programmes**

<u><b> Increasing Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) </b></u>

ICAN is targeted at improving the confidence and achievement of students in mathematics by using intervention strategies to tackle 4 key issues: learning gaps, language, motivation and memory.


<u><b> Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) </b></u>

The LSM programme provides better support for selected Primary 1 students who need more reinforcement in their learning of basic numeracy in mathematics. Students are placed in smaller groups and participate in customized activities based on their learning progress.


<u><b> Mathematics Learning Day/Experiential Learning </b></u>

Students will be involved in experiential and activity-based learning. They will explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills through authentic, meaningful and engaging activities. They will use real life resources and manipulatives to construct meaning and attain understanding.


<u><b> P1 Mathematics Parentâ€™s Workshop </b></u>

Parents will learn how their children learn Mathematics in the classroom. They will learn to use manipulatives, activities and games to reinforce mathematical concepts and skills with their children and help them to make mathematical connections in real life situations.
