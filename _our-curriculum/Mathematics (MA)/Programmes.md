<h4><strong>Increasing Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</strong></h4>
<p>ICAN is targeted at improving the confidence and achievement of students
in mathematics by using intervention strategies to tackle 4 key issues:
learning gaps, language, motivation and memory.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong></h4>
<p>The LSM programme provides better support for selected Primary 1 students
who need more reinforcement in their learning of basic numeracy in mathematics.
Students are placed in smaller groups and participate in customized activities
based on their learning progress.</p>
<h4><strong>Annual Math Week (Joy for Learning)</strong></h4>
<p>Math Week is a school wide event organised by the Mathematics Department.
It aims to nurture the joy and passion of learning Mathematics and helps
students to develop logical reasoning and critical thinking through engaging
and interactive recess games which involve the application of Math in real
life activities and using the different Math process skills.</p>
<p>Math Week is held annually over a period of one week, in conjunction with
International Day of Mathematics, with the themes of Mathematics for everyone
and Math Mysteries. With the help of our parent volunteers and teachers,
students were able to collaborate, participate and take up challenges in
different Math activities.</p>
<p>Students enjoyed a series of activities such as the learning of different
numeral systems around the world, solving math puzzles like Magic Square
and Sudoku, making connections between the mathematical concepts and its
application to their daily lives. We also had activities which ranged from
Math escape room, movie screening and making of Math thinking hats. These
enriching learning experiences helped to develop our students to be motivated
Math learners, confident problem solvers and reflective Math thinkers.</p>

<h4><strong>P1 Mathematics Parentâ€™s Workshop</strong></h4>
<p>Parents will learn how their children learn Mathematics in the classroom.
They will learn to use manipulatives, activities and games to reinforce
mathematical concepts and skills with their children and help them to make
mathematical connections in real life situations.</p>
