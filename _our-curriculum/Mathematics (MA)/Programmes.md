<h4><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong></h4>
<p>The LSM programme is an early intervention programme in mathematics for
students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills
when they enter Primary 1. The provision of support is up to 4 years but
students’ progress will be reviewed every semester.</p>
<p>The LSM programme focuses on&nbsp; building good mathematical understanding
and aims to build students’ confidence and positive beliefs about their
ability to do mathematics. Students learn mathematical concepts through
varied hands-on activities.</p>

<h4><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>E2K is developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education
and is a mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary high-ability
students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to
develop in students mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual
understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Students have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage
in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematics explorations.
The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students
to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess,
as well as to gain important 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies such as
critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
