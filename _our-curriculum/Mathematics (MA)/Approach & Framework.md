<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Fern Green Primary School adopts the 2013 Mathematics syllabus which reflects
the recent developments and trends in mathematics education. Our emphasis
is predominantly focussed on conceptual understanding, skill proficiencies
and mathematical processes which are integral elements to the development
of mathematical problem-solving strategies. Students will also be nurtured
to think logically, abstractly, critically, creatively and attained outcomes
that seek to address the 21st Century Competencies Framework as defined
by the MOE.</p>

<h4><strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To nurture all students to be creative thinkers, self-directed, independent
learners and innovative problem solvers by enriching them with mathematics
content, knowledge and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure that all students participate actively in all mathematics activities
so that they will be able to develop their content knowledge and be able
apply to this at higher levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enhance and realise the potential of all staff by establishing a continuous
cycle of relevant structured training and developmental programmes so that
all students will enjoy learning mathematics by utilising up-to-date teaching
methodology and practices.</p>

<h4><strong>Problem-based Learning &amp; Learning by Doing for Math @ Fern Green</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that students learn best through active participation in mathematical
discourse and collaboration with their peers. Therefore, we have specially
designed a series of enriching learning experiences through our problem-based
learning (PBL) packages, where students are able to make sound decisions
and practise responsible decision making. In FGPS, we tap on problem-based
learning as an inquiry approach whereby students have to think and work
in pairs or groups to solve a rich and realistic everyday problem.</p>
<p>We use effective questioning to develop active mathematical communication
skills and deepen learning in our students. This can promote logical and
systematic thinking and allow the students to make closer connection of
mathematics with real life. In our PBL lessons, students were tasked to
use real life objects to act it out to find the best possible or most effective
solution to their given tasks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning by doing is immensely advantageous in mastering mathematics.
When students actively engage with problems, apply concepts practically,
and use physical or virtual manipulatives, abstract mathematical ideas
become tangible and comprehensible. This concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA)
approach fosters deeper understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving
skills, ensuring that mathematical principles are not just memorized but
internalized for real-world applications.</p>
