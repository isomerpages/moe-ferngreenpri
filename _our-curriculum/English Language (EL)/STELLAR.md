# STELLAR


<b> STELLAR </b> (Strategies in the Teaching of the English Language Learning and Reading) provides a framework for the teaching and learning of the English Language. It aims to develop students’ listening, speaking, reading and writing competencies, as well as to promote a positive attitude towards reading. Besides the development of various language skills, there are opportunities for the development of social skills and self-directed learning.  

  

In the lower primary classrooms, students experience shared reading with their teachers and peers, Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) in writing and language activities.
