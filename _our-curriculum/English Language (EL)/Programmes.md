a range of reading comprehension strategies which they can use during the
regular English Language lessons.</p>
<h4><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation</strong></h4>

<p>Class activities expound on benefits that reading brings about, generating
readers’ interest in learning the language. A tale spun collaboratively
in words of five. A tongue twister spoken fast and fluently. A word spelt
accurately. It all begins with reading!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>‘Read for Books’ Charity Book Drive by National Library Board&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Committed to share the joy of reading with the community, the staff and

as collectibles.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h4><strong>Inquiry-based Learning</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Sparking a child’s curiosity is a gateway to igniting a lifelong love

Garden and National Orchid Garden, students ask questions about flowers
and leaves, conduct experiments to change the colours of flowers, and create
art pieces with flowers and leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
