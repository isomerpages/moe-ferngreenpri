Structure
---------

At Fern Green Primary School, the Whole School Approach would be used to promote the love of learning and use of Standard English. We also believe that students should cultivate good reading habits. Our students will be able to communicate confidently and effectively as a result of their development in the following areas of language learning:

*           Listening
*           Reading  
    
*           Speaking  
    
*           Writing  
    
*           Language Use (Grammar & Vocabulary)
