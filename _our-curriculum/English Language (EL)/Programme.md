<h3><strong>Structure</strong></h3><p>At Fern Green Primary School, the Whole School Approach would be used to promote the love of learning and use of Standard English. We also believe that students&nbsp;should&nbsp;cultivate good reading habits.&nbsp;Our students will be able to communicate confidently and effectively as a result of their development in the following areas of language learning:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Listening</p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Reading</p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking</p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Writing</p></li><li><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Language Use (Grammar &amp; Vocabulary)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Learning Support Programme</strong></p><p>The Learning Support Programme (LSP)&nbsp;aims to provide early intervention for Primary 1 and 2 students who need additional support in English literacy. Students are identified though a screening process. With the support given by the Learning Support Coordinator, students work on the spelling and word recognition skills.</p><p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme</strong></p><p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to support Primary 3 and 4 students who continue to face challenges in reading despite being supported in the LSP at Primary 1 and 2 levels. The programme offers the students a range of reading comprehension strategies which they can use during the regular English Language lessons.</p><p><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation</strong></p><p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme&nbsp;is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students who have been identified for support. Using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists, the programme aims to help the students acquire reading and spelling strategies.</p><p><strong>Extensive Reading Programme</strong></p><p>The Extensive Reading Programme aims to inculcate the habit of reading in students. Varied reading activities are conducted to encourage students to be immersed in a world of books.</p><p>1 ) Stories Alive!</p><p>Teachers, dressed as characters of stories, conduct storytelling sessions during recess and assembly periods. Students are given the opportunity to reflect and respond to the stories that they have heard by interviewing the&nbsp;<em>characters</em>&nbsp;and participating in post-reading activities.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL3.png"></div><p>2 ) D.E.A.R</p><p>D.E.A.R stands for&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>rop&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>verything&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>nd&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>ead. During the D.E.A.R session, teachers devote time for reading, be it at the class reading corner or the Media Resource Library. Parent volunteers are also recruited in our Reading Friends programme to read to the students. Individualised reading charts are displayed in classrooms to help students keep track of their reading progress.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL6.png"></div><p>3 ) Reader’s Theatre in Action</p><p>Reader’s Theatre in Action is an integrated approach to increase reading motivation, promote performing with a purpose, develop self-confidence and encourage teamwork.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL7.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL8.png"></div><p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning</strong></p><p>Inquiry-based learning is infused into the lessons to ignite students’ curiosity for a love of learning. Students spontaneously ask questions about a particular topic which is related with the STELLAR unit. They work collaboratively to find the answers to their questions. They also have the opportunities to make items related to what they learn.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL9.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/EL10.png"></div><p></p>
