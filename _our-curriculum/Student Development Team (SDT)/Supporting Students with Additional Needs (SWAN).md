<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>An inclusive culture for all.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To create an inclusive and supportive learning environment where every
student, including those with additional needs, is valued, respected, and
empowered to achieve their full potential.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Tiered System of Support for SWAN</strong></h4>
<p>Fern Green Primary School (FGPS) adopts the Tiered System of Support (TSS),
a whole-school systemic framework by MOE, in providing support for students
and managing schoolâ€™s resources effectively and efficiently. Special Educational
Needs (SEN) Officers and School Counsellor work hand in hand with teachers
to provide timely support for SWAN in their learning, behavioural and social-emotional
needs.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tier 1 is the core curriculum/ instruction provided to ALL students for
both academic and non-academic areas. Quality Tier 1 support plays a preventative
function by equipping all students with a good foundation in academic and
non-academic skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier 2 is early targeted support provided to <strong>SOME </strong>students.
SWAN are provided support in their specific areas of need (e.g., academic,
behavioural, social-emotional).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tier 3 is intensive targeted support provided to a <strong>FEW</strong> students.
who require MORE intensive and individualised intervention.</p>
