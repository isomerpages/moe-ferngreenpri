<h4><strong>Student Leadership at Fern Green Primary School</strong></h4>
<p><strong>VISION: Caring leaders who grow, glow and guide.</strong>
</p>
<p>At Fern Green Primary School, we believe that every student has the potential
to lead. We believe leadership is not about titles — it is about influence,
initiative and integrity. Through meaningful opportunities, mentorship
and reflection, FGians grow into caring leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GROW – GLOW – GUIDE</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three principles form the foundation of our 3-tiered leadership
approach.</p>

<p>Tier 1 - Growing Leaders: Through classroom leadership roles, students
build foundational leadership competencies such as responsibility, teamwork,
and initiative.</p>

<p>Tier 2 - Glowing Leaders: Students take on more visible and impactful
roles at the school level, inspiring their peers and contributing to school-wide
initiatives.</p>

<p>Tier 3 - Guiding Leaders: Selected leaders guide and mentor others, influencing
school culture and championing school values.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>To support our student leaders, we have adopted a structured framework
known as The Leadership Challenge Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner.
Through five key practices, this model serves as a leadership framework
that guides both our training and self-reflection practices.</p>

<p>Modelled after Singapore’s electoral process, our annual Head Prefect
Elections develop students’ civic literacy and encourage them to make informed
choices. Candidates give speeches, design campaign posters and participate
in interviews with school leaders.</p>
