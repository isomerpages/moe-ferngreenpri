# **Curriculum Approach**
Our science instructional approach begins with inquiry. 

To make Science learning coherent and meaningful, the 5E Instructional Model, or the 5Es, is used for the teaching and learning through inquiry. The 5 phases, consisting of engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation, are designed to facilitate the process of conceptual change.

The teacher is the leader of inquiry in the science classroom who creates a learning environment that will encourage and challenge students to develop their sense of inquiry.

# **Learning by Inquiry**

  
Science is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge. To enthuse students about what they are studying, hands-on learning is infused in all topics to help them learn fundamental concepts but also engage them in disciplinary thinking to think and act like young scientists where they develop science process skills and attitudes that are essential for scientific inquiry.

# **Learning by Doing**
In structuring and guiding the learning experience, we also aim to nurture maker mindsets by creating authentic platforms for students to expose our learners a new world of making and solving problems.

The scientific knowledge, skills and processes will be taught in a spiral approach for the 5 themes - Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions.
