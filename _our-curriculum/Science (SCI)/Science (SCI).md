The Science Department aims to nurture our students:

* as inquirers, who enjoy science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

* with the scientific literacy to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.
