<h4><strong>Fun Science@ Recess</strong></h4>
<p>Understanding that children are naturally curious, we strive to offer
them hands-on learning opportunities in Science. The remarkable participation
during Fun Science@Recess has clearly ignited a deep curiosity and a strong
desire among students to explore Science beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>During the paper chromatography activity, students uncovered the fascinating
fact that black ink is composed of different coloured inks. They thoroughly
enjoyed the process and proudly took home the beautiful, multi-coloured
flowers they created.</p>

<p>During the dancing raisins activity, students were amazed that the carbon
dioxide gas present in soda water can cause raisins to move up and down
in the solution.</p>

<p>This activity was made possible with the support of our parent volunteers,
science teachers, and E2K students. Numerous questions were posted on the
whiteboard, demonstrating that our students are becoming reflective inquirers.</p>

<h4><strong>STEM Challenge</strong></h4>
<p>To ignite our students’ curiosity and unleash their creativity, the Science
Department leveraged on STEM Playground Challenge organised by Curriculum
Planning &amp; Development Division, Science Centre and The James Dyson
Foundation. Through this STEM challenge, we hope to provide an opportunity
for our students to showcase their knowledge, skills and talents in a fun
and engaging way and to develop a deeper appreciation for the sciences
and technology.</p>
<p>Our students were very innovative and displayed their creativity by using
various recycled materials to make their prototypes. The teachers were
very heartened and inspired by all the submissions via the Padlet in the
Student Learning Space.</p>

<h4><strong>E2K Science</strong></h4>
<p>The E2K Science programme is part of the school’s enrichment programme
for upper primary students who demonstrate an interest and ability in Science.</p>
<p>The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills among
students who have an aptitude in Science, as well as nurture other important
21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical
and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>Students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists
use to generate knowledge in the subject. Just as scientists make mistakes
in the real world, students are given a safe space to make mistakes in
E2K while their teachers help them to learn from the mistakes. Through
collaborative learning and guidance provided by the teachers, students
practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence
in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes
and dispositions.</p>
