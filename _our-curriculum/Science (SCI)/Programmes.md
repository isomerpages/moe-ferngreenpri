<h4><strong>Fun Science@ Recess</strong></h4>
<p>Understanding that children are naturally curious, we strive to offer
them hands-on learning opportunities in Science. The remarkable participation
during Fun Science@Recess has clearly ignited a deep curiosity and a strong
desire among students to explore Science beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>During the paper chromatography activity, students uncovered the fascinating
fact that black ink is composed of different coloured inks. They thoroughly
enjoyed the process and proudly took home the beautiful, multi-coloured
flowers they created.</p>
