# **Science Holistic Assessment**
Assessment is an integral part of our teaching and learning process. Formative assessment is interwoven with our inquiry teaching. To provide our students with a holistic assessment, our teachers use varied modes of assessment ranging from journaling, practical, written papers, model making, online quizzes, projects to teacherâ€™s observations.
