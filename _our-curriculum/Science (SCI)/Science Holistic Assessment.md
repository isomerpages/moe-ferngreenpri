<p>Assessment is an integral part of our teaching and learning process. Formative
assessment is interwoven with our inquiry teaching. To provide our students
with a holistic assessment, our teachers use varied modes of assessment
ranging from journaling, practical, written papers, model making, online
quizzes, projects to teacherâ€™s observations.</p>
