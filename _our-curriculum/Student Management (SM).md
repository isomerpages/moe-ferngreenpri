<p>The Student Management Department looks into the overall well-being of
the students. In FGPS the Student Management Team provides the support
for every student to be developed into an independent and self-disciplined
learner.</p>
<p>The Student Management Team provides the first line of support through
pastoral care and developing social emotional skills in every student.
This support is aimed at developing the studentâ€™s resilience in managing
their daily lives as they acquire the Social Emotional Competencies of
Self-awareness, Self-management, Social-awareness, Relationship management
and Responsible decision making.</p>
<p>Discipline is a learning process and is carried out with care. The school
adopts the restorative practices in its approach to discipline. Through
this process, students understand and sensitize the situation and becomes
aware of the impact of his actions and its implications on others.</p>
<p>The Student Management Department also supports students with additional
needs. Our approach to this is identify students in need, support them
and collaborate with relevant personnel to help these students. It is important
to identify these students early and provide them with both the internal
and external support structures to ensure that every student with additional
needs is supported throughout their years in FGPS.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the Student Management Department is to develop a culture
of care through Peer Support and Relationship (PSR). With proper guidance,
students will be able to be caring buddies for their peers. Selected students
will be develop as Peer Support Leaders who are keen befrienders and will
champion PSR among the students.</p>
<p>All these will be done through the Student Development Team consisting
of the Head of Department CCE, Head of Department Student Management, Year
Heads, Assistant Year Heads and staff trained in counselling and additional
needs support.</p>
