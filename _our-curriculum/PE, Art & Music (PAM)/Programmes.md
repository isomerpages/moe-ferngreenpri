<p><strong>P1 Art Milestone Programme – Action Painting</strong>
</p>

<p>P1 students explore emotions through abstract painting inspired by Kandinsky
and Pollock, using music and unconventional tools. Working in groups, they
create mixed-media collages reflecting their feelings. This fosters collaboration
and emotional awareness through creative play.</p>

<p>P2 students create trioramas—three-dimensional miniature scenes with three
visible sides— inspired by Liu Kang and Cheong Soo Pieng’s artworks. Using
paper collage and recycled materials, they illustrate neighbourhood scenes.
Through this, they explore depth, composition, and storytelling by applying
foreground, middle ground, and background concepts.</p>
