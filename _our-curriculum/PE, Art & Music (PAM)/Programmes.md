<h4><strong>PE</strong></h4>
<p>Aligned with our school’s Vision and Mission, the Physical Education (PE)
curriculum at Fern Green Primary is designed to nurture the holistic development
of every child. Infused with values education, Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE), and Emerging 21st Century Competencies (e21CC), our PE
programme empowers students to grow in both body and mind.</p>
<p>Through a <strong>spiral progression</strong>, students develop key physical
skills and deepen their knowledge of physical health across their six years.
