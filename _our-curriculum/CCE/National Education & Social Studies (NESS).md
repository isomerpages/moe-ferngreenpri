<p>The National Education (NE) programme in FGPS aims to provide opportunities
and experiences for our students to explore their identity as Singaporeans
and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.</p>

to inquire into real-world issues that concerns their lives. Through inquiry
and authentic learning experiences, the curriculum helps students attain
relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical
