# **CCE LESSONS**

CCE lessons refer to the teaching of values, knowledge and skills. CCE lessons are conducted in the Mother Tongue Language,  through process-based approaches such as:


<u> • Story telling Approach </u>

Story-telling Approach involves telling stories, both fictional and real-life, to facilitate the internalisation of values. Teachers can use a variety of cultural stories, stories of heroes and everyday stories to help students understand the need to practise good values, and for students to clarify their feelings through reflection exercises. It is important to choose appropriate stories according to the students’ age and interests.

  

Students are guided in identifying personal beliefs and values when they relate their personal experiences, construct their own stories or consider another person’s story. The approach requires open-ended questioning, clarifying, summarising, building on each person’s contributions and encouraging students to respond to one another.

  

<u> • Consideration Approach </u>

Consideration Approach builds on empathy and aims to develop a caring personality. The crucial question to ask in perspective-taking is “How would you feel if you were that person?” A student learns that making a moral decision involves taking into consideration the impact of that decision on others. By adopting the perspective of the other person, the student attempts to understand the thoughts and feelings of that person and develops a balanced view of the situation. This is done through employing strategies such as role-playing and questioning.

  
<u> • Cognitive Development Approach </u>


Students are encouraged to respond to real or hypothetical moral dilemma situations and guided to rank their responses. This process will help students to examine their  

motives behind their actions and raise their level of self-awareness. It enables students to progress from a self-centred perspective to higher stages of moral development, focusing

on societal and universal perspectives.

  
<u> • Experiential Learning Approach </u>


In Experiential Learning Approach, students go through a cycle of experiences, observation, reflection and application as they engage in learning in and out of classroom. Students are given experiences and platforms that enable them to reflect on values, concepts and ideas, and to internalise the values through the application of skills and knowledge learnt in real-world situations. By deriving meaning from doing, students are more likely to take ownership of their learning and transfer their learning into new situations when they have  

experienced it. Students reflect, evaluate and make decisions based on the values they have internalised and put their values into action.

  

  

• Modified Values Clarification Approach

Modified Values Clarification Approach involves a step-by-step process that helps students to make well considered decisions. Students are also stimulated to think about and clarify their values through examining their personal feelings and behaviour patterns using rational thinking, empathy and emotional awareness. By applying strategies such as dialoguing and cooperative learning, teachers will guide students to make decisions based on a sound value system that includes values upheld by society. The Responsible Decision Making process includes identifying and evaluating options, making a decision, taking a stand and living according to one’s convictions.

  

  

A process based teaching approach comprises instructional strategies such as:

  

• Role-playing

• Cooperative Learning

• Reflection

• Clarify, Sensitive, influence (CSI) questioning process

• Thinking Routines

• Group work

• Circle Processes
