<p>Our environment is our most precious resource and FGPS aims to teach our
students to be active advocates for the environment. Students learn to
reduce, reuse, and recycle. They also learn how they can play an active
role in reducing environmental damage to our planet and what they can do
to influence others to be more environmentally conscious.</p>
