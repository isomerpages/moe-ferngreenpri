# NATIONAL EDUCATION (NE)

In FGPS, we believe that

*   NE is important for nurturing future citizens, to inspire in our young a sense of belonging to the nation, and guide them to be knowledgeable about local and global issues. This develops our young to better understand, appreciate and commit to their role as responsible and caring citizens, and be loyal to what the nation stands for.Â   
    
*   NE is infused into classroom-based lessons like Character and Citizenship Education, Social Studies, English and Mother Tongue Languages and the four NE commemorative days, Learning Journeys and Values in Action.

We aim to meaningfully and appropriately engage our young to feel a genuine sense of commitment and conviction to one another and to what we stand for collectively as Singaporeans.

2) International Friendship Day (4 April 2018)
