# **INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY COMMEMORATION**

![](/images/IFD.jpeg)

Globalisation provides us with the opportunity to appreciate and live together with friends with different traditions, languages, cultures and histories.  It is important to encourage our youth to continue actively deepening the connection with our neighbours by empowering them in this process of celebrating our vibrancy and building our community.

The school celebrated International Friendship Day on 10 April 2019. Prior to the event, students had an ASEAN doll making session on 3 April and an IFD briefing on 8 April. Students’ ASEAN paper dolls were displayed around the school prior to the event.

There were booths set up during recess for students to understand the flags, greetings, costumes and food of our ASEAN neighbours. Students participated in these activities and received tokens. During assembly, students enjoyed a play and listened to the experiences of two ASEAN parents on what it is like to live in Malaysia and Vietnam. Teacher and students were engaged during this special sharing by parents.
