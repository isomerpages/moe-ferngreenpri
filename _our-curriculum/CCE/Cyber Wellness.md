<p>The focus of Cyber Wellness in FGPS is teaching students to be responsible
digital learners. Students learn to demonstrate respect for self and others,
and practise safe and responsible use when navigating the cyberspace. Students
also learn to be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for
collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as become advocates for
the positive use of technology.</p>
