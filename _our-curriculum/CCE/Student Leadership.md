# **Student Leadership**

The school’s approach to student leadership focuses on a school-wide, Leadership–For-All approach. We believe that every child can be a leader if given the appropriate training, experience and opportunity.

We adopt the TEA (Training, Experience, Application) approach in developing leadership in our students.

1) Training – We provide training for our students based on the following developmental modules:

*   Self-Management (Pr 1 and 2) – Able to regulate one’s behavior and act appropriately as a leader (Confidence, character traits)  
    
*   People management (Pr 3 and4)– How to manage people in a team (Communication, understanding, conflict management)  
    
*   Project Management (Pr 5 and 6) – How to plan and implement a project

We give every student a chance to be a leader

2) Experience (Students are appointed as a Classroom or a Key Student Leader).

Classroom leaders: Monitors, Group leaders, Discipline leaders (Rotated termly)  

Key leaders: Prefects 

Key leaders undergo a rigorous selection process and are expected to be role models at all times to other students.  They will serve for a period of one year and will be nominated on a yearly basis.  performance is monitored regularly and feedback is given by the teachers in charge to the key leaders.

3) Application (We give upper primary students a chance to be involved in working on fund raising, school improvement or environmental protection projects)

Environmental protection projects can be in the form of beach cleaning, park cleaning or Assembly talks to peers on how to protect the environment
