# **Values in Action (VIA)**

FGPS’s values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony are defined as follows: 

  

1.  Respect – Believes in his own self-worth and the intrinsic worth of all people.  
    
2.  Responsibility – Recognises he has a duty to himself, his family, his community, his nation and the world. He fulfills his duties with love and commitment  
    
3.  Resilience – Has emotional strength and perseveres in the face of challenges  
    
4.  Integrity – upholds ethical principles and has the courage to stand up for what is right  
    
5.  Care – Acts with kindness and compassion. Contributes to the betterment of the community and the world  
    
6.  Harmony – Promotes social cohesion and appreciates the unity and diversity of a multicultural society  
    

  

We inculcate values in our students through a variety of programs including Form-teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), Environment Education and CCE lessons conducted in Mother Tongue. This year, we are focusing on the value of Care. Students will learn about care through our partnerships with charitable organisations (such as TTSH Community Fund) and the community (such as Southeast CDC for the Walk for Rice program.)
