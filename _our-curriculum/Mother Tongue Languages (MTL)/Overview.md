<h4><strong><u>Approach/Framework</u></strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Mother Tongue is a living language. It is used and valued in our society.
To help learners to be active learners and proficient users of the Mother
Tongue languages, Fern Green Primary School MTL department aims to support
learners from diverse backgrounds learn the language by focusing on ways
to engage the learners.</p>
<h4><strong>Department Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Effective communicator and critical thinkers who are cultural savvy and
globally connected.</p>
<h4><strong>Goals/Objectives</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nurturing learners to be culturally rooted individuals.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipping learners with the skills to apply their MTL in real life settings
and to use it for communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing learners to be Confident Persons, Self-directed Learners, Concerned
Citizens and Active Contributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key MTL Approaches</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language learning takes place in naturalistic settings, hence more focus
is placed on the communicative aspect. To learn the language in the initial
stages, the learner will learn comprehensible input (e.g. through the use
of words and phrases that the learner can understand readily from their
familiar context) and have opportunities to use the language meaningfully
in natural interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students from diverse background have different needs. To cater to such
needs, differentiate instructions will be applied to ensure pupils achieve
the learning outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster self-directed learning and maintain students' interest, we employ
a range of pedagogical techniques, including e-pedagogies, cooperative
learning strategies, gamification, role play, and more. These approaches
are pivotal as students delve into their areas of interest within the given
topics.</p>
