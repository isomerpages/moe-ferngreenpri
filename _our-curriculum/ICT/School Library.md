<p>Our School Library Team aims to promote and cultivate a positive disposition
towards books and support students in their learning in a resource-rich
environment that supports and enhances students' academic, intellectual,
and personal growth.</p>
<p>Our activities aim to help students develop lifelong learning and a love
of reading. To achieve this, the team collaborates with the various departments
and partners such as the National Library Board for reading activities,
book talks and to provide conducive spaces and resources for students to
read, collaborate and learn.</p>

<h4><strong>Library Activities and Programmes</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Class Library Visits</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting students to experience the joy of reading is a regular part of
the school’s curriculum.</p>
<p>A period (one for English, one for Mother Tongue) is set aside every fortnight
for our reading programme. Students enjoy a range of activities during
these periods. These include storytelling and book recommendations. In
alternative weeks, students are brought to the library to borrow books
and do book-related activities</p>
<p>Library supports other departments’ programmes and activities e.g. EL
Fiesta, MTL Fortnight and Math Week by promoting books related to their
programmes.</p>

<p>As our school also hopes to develop students’ competencies in distilling
and discerning information online, we have introduced students to the OPAC
and SERR platforms. Through these official platforms, students are able
to perform a search of books and resources available in the school library
as well as access a virtual library to extend on their learning and love
of reading through multimodal reading resources.</p>
