# **CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (CCA)**

### **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**

(CCAs are offered from Primary 3 level onwards)

CCA are a key component of students’ holistic education. In Fern Green Primary School, we aspire to provide students with the opportunity to discover their interests and talents in the CCA of their choice. To enhance the holistic stance of CCA in Fern Green Primary School, we integrate character building and the learning of values, social emotional competencies and skills in all our CCA through well-planned and comprehensive CCA plans.

In line with the School’s Desired Culture of Care and to promote the “Kampung Spirit”, we also aim to build camaraderie among students from diverse backgrounds through interactions during CCA sessions. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community.
