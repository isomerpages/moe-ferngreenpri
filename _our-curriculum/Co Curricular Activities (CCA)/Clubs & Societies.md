<h4><strong>Art Club</strong></h4>
<p>Art Club brings together students from diverse backgrounds and experiences
to deepen their sense of belonging in the community. Prior knowledge and
skills are not a requisite to join the CCA, but a sense of commitment and
dedication are strongly encouraged. Through art making and art appreciation,
students learn more about themselves and their interactions with others.
Students visited the Sengkang Riverside Park to hone their life drawing
skills and made close observations. These experiences shape their character,
develop values and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies for them to thrive
in the current world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Makers’ Club</strong></h4>
<p>The Makers’ Club CCA at our school offers students invaluable opportunities
to cultivate 21st century competencies. By participating in diverse activities
like making lamps using recyclables, constructing mini brick houses, and
crafting ornaments, students sharpen their critical thinking, creativity,
logical reasoning, and communication skills. Engaging in meaningful projects,
such as creating decorative pieces for the school using quilling techniques
and teaching seniors craftwork at the Active Ageing Centre as part of a
VIA project, further enriches their learning experience. This CCA empowers
students to work both independently and collaboratively, preparing them
for success in the modern world.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Outdoor Adventure Club</strong></h4>
<p>Outdoor Adventure Club exposes our students to various outdoor skills
and activities. As students cultivate interest and love for the outdoors,
they also learn about issues plaguing the environment and put what they
learn into the conservation of natural spaces for the sustained enjoyment
of outdoor activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students learn skills like first aid and navigation which allows them
to appreciate the outdoors in a safe and enjoyable manner. Campcraft is
also introduced as using a problem-based learning approach where students
are provided basic skills and put them into action to overcome challenges
presented to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club serves as an avenue for students to pursue their interest in
the outdoors, practice adaptive thinking as well as shape their character
and values as they strive to preserve nature.&nbsp;</p>
