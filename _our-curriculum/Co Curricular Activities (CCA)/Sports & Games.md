<h4><strong>Football (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong></h4>
<p>At Fern Green Primary School, the Football CCA aims to cultivate a passion
for the sport while nurturing holistic development in its participants.
The primary objective is to instill fundamental skills, foster teamwork,
and promote character building through each session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sessions begin with basic skill drills such as dribbling, passing, and
shooting, tailored to suit the abilities of all students. As students'
progress, the focus shifts to tactical understanding and game strategy,
encouraging critical thinking and decision-making on the field. Coaches
prioritize inclusivity, ensuring every participant feels valued and supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Character development is woven into every aspect of the program. Through
team-building exercises and friendly competitions, students learn the values
of sportsmanship, perseverance, and collaboration. These lessons extend
beyond the pitch, shaping students into well-rounded individuals equipped
with essential life skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical fitness is also emphasized, with sessions incorporating dynamic
warm-ups, conditioning drills, and small-sided games. By promoting an active
lifestyle, the Football CCA not only enhances students' physical health
but also fosters habits that contribute to their overall well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the Football CCA at Fern Green Primary School goes beyond
teaching football skills. It serves as a platform for holistic development,
empowering students to excel both on and off the field, and instilling
values that will guide them throughout their lives.&nbsp;</p>
