The Zero Corridor is a proud product of the collaboration between Fern Green Primary School, Building Construction Authority (BCA) and Keppel Land Limited (KLL).Â   
  
Leveraging the GreenSeeds Funds, an initiative by BCA and KLL, the school seeks to champion green efforts with its grounds-up ideas on up-cycling waste materials, and through educating the students and the public on the importance of preserving our nature.
