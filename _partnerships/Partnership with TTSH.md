<h4><strong>TTSH Project Hong Bao</strong></h4>
<p>The school took part in TTSH’s Project Hong Bao fundraising activity this
Lunar New Year. Our children created and decorated their red packets and
penned messages of encouragement to the needy patients, many of whom are
the elderly sick. They also donated some of their Hong Bao money.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Nurses Day</strong></h4>
<p>To instill the value of Care in our students, the school collaborated
with Tan Tock Seng Hospital to commemorate Nurses Day this year. Nurses
play an important role in caring for patients and ensuring that they are
well supported during the recovery process. For the Nurses' Day on 1 August,
our students will learn about what nurses do and how they are so important
in Patients’ recovery process. The children will also design a card and
pen down notes of appreciation to appreciate the efforts of our nurses.</p>
