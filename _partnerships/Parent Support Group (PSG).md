their parents have deep concern for them and possess keen interest in their
school experiences and education. It will motivate students to adopt positive
attitudes towards learning and better personal development. Parents will
have greater awareness of their children’s school learning environment
and will identify better with their children’s school experiences. PSG
plays an important role in the school and provides a voice that has an
impact on school’s climate, programmes and directions. So come, join in

and encouraged to do better. Our PSG welcomes new members!</p>
