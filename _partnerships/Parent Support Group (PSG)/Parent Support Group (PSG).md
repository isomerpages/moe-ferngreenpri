Parental involvement in school sends a strong signal to students that their parents have deep concern for them and possess keen interest in their school experiences and education. It will motivate students to adopt positive attitudes towards learning and better personal development. Parents will have greater awareness of their children’s school learning environment and will identify better with their children’s school experiences. PSG plays an important role in the school and provides a voice that has an impact on school’s climate, programmes and directions. So come, join in the ‘Kampong Spirit’ in Fern Green Primary School, be a member of PSG in FGPS now! Play an active role in your children’s school experiences and growth.
