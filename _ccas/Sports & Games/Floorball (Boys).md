<p>The Floorball CCA at Fern Green Primary School offers students the opportunity
to experience an exciting and fast-paced indoor sport that develops agility,
coordination, and strategic thinking. Through structured training sessions,
students learn essential skills such as ball control, passing, and shooting,
while improving their overall fitness.</p>
<p>Beyond physical development, the CCA places strong emphasis on values
such as discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship. Students participate
in team-building activities and friendly matches that foster collaboration
and resilience. Leadership opportunities are also provided, allowing students
to grow in confidence and take responsibility within their teams.</p>
<p>Each session includes warm-ups, skill drills, and gameplay that promote
both physical health and team cohesion. With a focus on inclusivity, the
Floorball CCA welcomes students of all skill levels and supports their
journey in becoming confident, respectful, and team-oriented individuals.</p>

<p>Our students are given the opportunity to participate in friendly matches
with schools such as Huamin Primary School, gaining confidence and match
experience. To further develop their potential, our players represent the
school in the NSG, National School Games. Our senior boys team managed
to be promoted to NSG League 2 after topping their group. Throughout the
season, they displayed grit, determination, and an unbreakable team spirit—fighting
for every goal and supporting one another every step of the way. We are
proud of their efforts in every game, as each player gains valuable experience
and continues to grow into a stronger and more confident athlete.</p>

national athletes who inspired them with their expertise and passion for
the sport.</p>
