<p>The Basketball CCA at Fern Green Primary School provides a structured
and supportive environment for students to develop their physical skills,
confidence, and character. Through regular training sessions, students
are introduced to the fundamentals of the game, including dribbling, passing,
shooting, and team play.</p>
<p>The CCA places strong emphasis on values such as discipline, teamwork,
and resilience. Students engage in drills, strategy-based activities, and
friendly matches that build both their athletic abilities and social-emotional
skills. Each session incorporates dynamic warm-ups, skill-based drills,
and small-sided games to enhance fitness and coordination. By promoting
an active lifestyle, the Basketball CCA supports students in building lifelong
healthy habits.</p>
<p>More than just a sport, Basketball serves as a platform for holistic development,
nurturing well-rounded individuals who learn to lead, collaborate, and
persevere—both on and off the court.</p>
