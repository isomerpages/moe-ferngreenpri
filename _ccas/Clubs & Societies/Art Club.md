<p>Art Club brings together students from diverse backgrounds and experiences
to deepen their sense of belonging in the community. Prior knowledge and
skills are not a requisite to join the CCA, but a sense of commitment and
dedication are strongly encouraged. Through art making and art appreciation,
students learn more about themselves and their interactions with others.
Students visited the Sengkang Riverside Park to hone their life drawing
skills and made close observations. These experiences shape their character,
develop values and 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies for them to thrive
in the current world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
