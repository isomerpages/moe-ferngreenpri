<p>Wordsmithsâ€™ Club gives students the opportunity to build confidence and
sharpen their thinking through debate, Scrabble and public speaking. They
learn to express ideas clearly, think on their feet and collaborate with
others, while developing language skills, resilience and teamwork.</p>
<p>Students take part in engaging sessions that focus on communication,&nbsp;
strategy and vocabulary. The club also encourages creativity, respectful
discussion and a love for using words meaningfully. Students get to practise
in a safe and friendly environment that encourages growth and self-expression.
They also receive opportunities to present during school assemblies and
represent the school in competitions such as the Wits and Words: Inter-school
Debate Championship.</p>
