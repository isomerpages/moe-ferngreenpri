<p>The Infocomm and Media Club CCA offers a comprehensive and progressive
learning journey for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6, focusing on
infocomm and media production. P3 students embark on their creative adventure
with clay animation, planning their stories using storyboards, crafting
characters from modeling clay, and bringing their narratives to life through
stop-motion techniques. In P4, students delve into the world of coding
with Scratch programming, where they create their own games and stories,
while also acquiring basic audio-visual skills. By P5, students advance
to exploring the world of Microbits and developing their own apps using
Thunkable, fostering their problem-solving and programming abilities. Finally,
in P6, students master the art of professional photography and videography,
gaining essential skills in capturing and editing high-quality visuals,
and documenting school events. This CCA not only nurtures creativity and
technical expertise but also ignites a passion for digital media among
young learners, preparing them for a technologically advanced future.</p>
