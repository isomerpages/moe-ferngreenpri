<p>The Infocomm and Media Club provides students with a structured and progressive
learning experience from Primary 3 to Primary 6, focusing on both infocomm
technology and media production. Through activities such as clay animation,
coding, game development, photography, and videography, students gain hands-on
exposure to digital creation and storytelling. The CCA fosters essential
21st Century Competencies, including critical and inventive thinking, effective
communication, collaboration, as well as information and media literacy.
By engaging in authentic media production tasks, such as creating content
