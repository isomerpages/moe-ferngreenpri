<h4><strong>Outdoor Adventure Club</strong></h4>
<p>Outdoor Adventure Club exposes our students to various outdoor skills
and activities. As students cultivate interest and love for the outdoors,
they also learn about issues plaguing the environment and put what they
learn into the conservation of natural spaces for the sustained enjoyment
of outdoor activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students learn skills like first aid and navigation which allows them
to appreciate the outdoors in a safe and enjoyable manner. Campcraft is
also introduced as using a problem-based learning approach where students
are provided basic skills and put them into action to overcome challenges
presented to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club serves as an avenue for students to pursue their interest in
the outdoors, practice adaptive thinking as well as shape their character
and values as they strive to preserve nature.&nbsp;</p>
