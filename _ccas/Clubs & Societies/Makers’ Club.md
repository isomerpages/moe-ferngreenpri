<p>The Makers’ Club CCA at our school offers students invaluable opportunities
to cultivate 21st century competencies. By participating in diverse activities
like making lamps using recyclables, constructing mini brick houses, and
crafting ornaments, students sharpen their critical thinking, creativity,
logical reasoning, and communication skills. Engaging in meaningful projects,
such as creating decorative pieces for the school using quilling techniques
and teaching seniors craftwork at the Active Ageing Centre as part of a
VIA project, further enriches their learning experience. This CCA empowers
students to work both independently and collaboratively, preparing them
for success in the modern world.&nbsp;</p>
