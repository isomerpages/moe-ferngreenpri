<p>At Fern Green Primary School, the Makers CCA fosters creativity and innovation
through a dynamic mix of analogue and digital making. This hands-on, minds-on
programme encourages students to explore, experiment, and invent as they
work on meaningful projects.</p>
<p>From tinkering with tools and crafting with recycled materials to experimenting
with 3D pens and basic coding, students bring their ideas to life in exciting
and tangible ways. Through collaborative tasks and design thinking challenges,
they develop resilience, adaptability, and creative problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Whether they’re building simple prototypes or exploring tech-based solutions
to real-world issues, our young makers grow into confident, imaginative
creators ready to shape the future.</p>
