<p>Fern Green Cub Scouts strives to transform students into responsible,
confident and resilient leaders through its values-based educational programme.
A Cub Scout is expected to uphold the Scout Promise and Scout Law, both
of which are closely aligned to Core Values within the MOE 21st Century
Competencies framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>The Scout Promise</u></em></strong>&nbsp;
<br><em>On my honour, &nbsp; <br>I promise that Iâ€™ll do my best,<br>To do my duty to God,&nbsp; <br>And to the Republic of Singapore,&nbsp; <br>To help other people,&nbsp; <br>And to keep the Scout Law</em>
</p>
<p><strong><u>The Scout Law</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout is to be trusted. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout is loyal. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout is disciplined and considerate.</em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout has courage in all difficulties.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Cub Scouts engage in healthy balance of indoor and outdoor activities.
These activities impart essential life skills and broaden their social
awareness. All Cub Scouts will be provided with opportunities to lead other
members in their patrol groups and to embark on community service projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, to develop their metacognitive skills, our Cub Scouts
routinely reflect on their learning experiences and ask themselves what
they could have done better. Our Cub Scouts regularly record down their
thoughts and feelings in their personal Scout journal, allowing them to
keep track of their growth and to share these experiences with their peers
and parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fern Green Cub Scouts warmly welcomes students from all backgrounds and
interests to join us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
