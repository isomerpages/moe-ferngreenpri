<p>Fern Green Cub Scouts strives to transform students into responsible and
resilient leaders through its values-based educational programme. A Cub
Scout is expected to uphold the Scout Promise and Scout Law, both of which
are closely aligned to Core Values within the MOE 21st Century Competencies
framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>The Scout Promise</u></em> 
<br><em>On my honour,&nbsp; <br>I promise that I’ll do my best,<br>To do my duty to God, <br>And to the Republic of Singapore, <br>To help other people, <br>And to keep the Scout Law</em>
</p>
<p><u>The Scout Law</u> 
<br><em>A scout is to be trusted. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout is loyal. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations. </em>&nbsp;
<br><em>A scout is disciplined and considerate.</em> 
<br><em>A scout has courage in all difficulties.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Cub Scouts engage in a healthy balance of indoor and outdoor activities.
These activities impart essential life skills and broaden their knowledge
of the world. All Cub Scouts will be provided with opportunities to lead
other members in their patrol groups and to embark on community service
projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, to develop their metacognitive skills, our Cub Scouts
routinely reflect on their learning experiences and ask themselves what
they could have done better. Our Cub Scouts regularly record down their
thoughts and feelings in their personal Scout journal, allowing them to
keep track of their growth and to share these experiences with their peers
and parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fern Green Cub Scouts warmly welcomes students from all backgrounds and
interests to join us.</p>
