<p>Harmonica Ensemble CCA offers students a unique and enriching musical
experience. In this program, participants learn to play the chromatic harmonica,
an instrument known for its versatility and expressive sound. Students
in the ensemble develop important musical skills such as reading sheet
music, understanding harmony, and improving their sense of rhythm. Students
with a strong foundation in music, particularly a good sense of rhythm,
will have opportunities to explore different instruments such as the bass
harmonica, chord harmonica, and piano.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaborative nature of the ensemble fosters values such as teamwork
and harmony as players must synchronize their parts to create cohesive
performances. Our CCA students really enjoy performing together, whether
it's for school events or out in the community. This provides opportunities
for performances, boosting students' confidence, and stage presence.</p>
<p>“<em>We are the Harmonica Ensemble CCA, and it is called Harmo-nica – because we believe in being in harmony, both in music and as a team.</em>”
– <em>Kyle Christensen Deng, Primary 4</em>

<p>During each CCA session, musicians undergo structured training with harmonica
instructors that develop their musical and instrument handling techniques,
all while making them comfortable in performing for events. Sessions normally
start off with warm-ups, followed by music scales practice and working
on different music sections of a song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the second batch of Harmonica Ensemble students joining us, we would
be preparing for our first Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation
happening in early 2025, as well as upcoming performances.&nbsp;</p>

and would continue to light up the stage with familiar tunes in future
events!</p>
