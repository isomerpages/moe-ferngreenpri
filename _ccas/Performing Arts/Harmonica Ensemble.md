<p>Our Harmonica Ensemble CCA offers students a unique and enriching musical
experience. In this program, participants learn to play the chromatic harmonica,
an instrument known for its versatility and expressive sound. Students
in the ensemble develop important musical skills such as reading sheet
music, understanding harmony, and improving their sense of rhythm. Students
with a strong foundation in music, particularly a good sense of rhythm,
will have opportunities to explore different instruments such as the bass
harmonica, chord harmonica, and piano.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaborative nature of the ensemble fosters values such as teamwork
and harmony as players must synchronize their parts to create cohesive
performances. Additionally, Harmonica Ensemble provides opportunities for
performances, boosting students' confidence and stage presence.&nbsp;</p>
