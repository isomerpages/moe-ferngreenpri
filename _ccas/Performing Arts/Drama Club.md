<p>The Drama Club ignites creativity through theatrical expression, fostering
a vibrant community of performers and enthusiasts. Through rehearsals and
productions, members explore diverse roles, hone acting skills, and cultivate
stagecraft expertise. Collaborative endeavours like script readings, creating
tableaus and improvised sessions are some of the activities conducted to
enrich the experience, fostering teamwork and innovation among members.
They get to put up a performance at the Annual Prize-giving Day and have
the opportunity to participate in playwrighting competitions too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the spotlight, the club nurtures confidence, empathy, and communication
skills vital for personal and professional growth. Ultimately, it is a
haven where passion meets performance, shaping unforgettable memories and
lifelong friendships.&nbsp;</p>
