<p>The Modern Dance CCA at Fern Green aims to expose students to the enriching
art of dance. It offers opportunities to creatively explore genres such
as hip hop and contemporary dance, encouraging students to step out of
their comfort zones and strive for excellence. Believing that "Everyone
Can Dance," the CCA emphasizes the right attitude and determination. Through
dance, students express their talents and forge new friendships, working
together towards common goals. The CCA also includes viewing external performances,
broadening their exposure to various dance genres and techniques. Modern
Dance CCA also instils strong values, making it more than just an aesthetic
pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
