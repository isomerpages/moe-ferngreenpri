<p>The Modern Dance CCA at Fern Green Primary School provides students with
a dynamic platform to explore the art of movement through genres such as
hip hop and contemporary dance. It encourages creativity, rhythm, and self-expression
while nurturing confidence and discipline in every dancer.</p>
<p>Rooted in the belief that <em>“Everyone Can Dance”,</em> the CCA promotes
a growth mindset where students are guided to embrace challenges, work
collaboratively, and strive for excellence. Dancers learn the value of
perseverance, resilience, and teamwork as they prepare for performances
and school events.</p>
<p>To broaden their exposure, students also attend external showcases and
performances, deepening their appreciation for diverse dance styles and
techniques. Through these experiences, the CCA fosters not only artistic
growth but also character development.</p>
<p>Modern Dance at Fern Green is more than just a CCA—it is a meaningful
journey that shapes confident, passionate, and well-rounded individuals.</p>

<p>During each CCA session, dancers underwent structured training that focused
on mastering dance techniques, building stamina, and enhancing stage presence.
Sessions began with warm-ups, followed by skill-based drills and choreography
practice. Dancers also participated in creative movement activities to
foster expression and coordination.</p>
<p>These weekly training culminated in polished performances for key events
such as the <strong>Chinese New Year Performance</strong>, <strong>Awards Presentation Day 2025</strong> and <strong>Chingay @ Fernvale</strong>,
where dancers showcased their teamwork, discipline, and creativity. They
demonstrated their growth through energetic and well-coordinated routines
that reflected the hours of commitment put in during CCA sessions.</p>
<p>Currently, the dancers are rehearsing for the upcoming <strong>Fern Green Primary School Open House</strong>,
where they will once again take the stage to represent the school with
pride. These performance opportunities not only celebrate their hard work
but also deepen their passion and confidence in the performing arts.</p>
