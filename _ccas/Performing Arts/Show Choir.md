<p>FGPS Show Choir is a dynamic community of performers who expresses themselves
through choral singing and choreographed dancing, resulting in a vibrant
and engaging display. Our Show Choir aims to cultivate our children’s passion
in Music through fun and upbeat songs, while deepening their appreciation
of the Arts through classical choral pieces. Our rehearsals focus not only
on vocal techniques and choreography, but also on dedication, showmanship,
resilience and teamwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FGPS Show Choir offers our students invaluable experiences, fostering
discipline, confidence and a sense of camaraderie. It provides our young
performers a chance to shine and express themselves creatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Show Choir has been invited to perform at various school events and
community functions, including the PassionArts Festival cum National Day
Celebration at Fernvale CC in 2023 and the Fernvale Mothers’ Day Celebrations
in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
