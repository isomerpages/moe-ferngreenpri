<p>(CCAs are offered from Primary 3 level onwards)</p>
<p>CCA are a key component of students’ holistic education. In Fern Green
Primary School, we aspire to provide students with the opportunity to discover
their interests and talents in the CCA of their choice. To enhance the
holistic stance of CCA in Fern Green Primary School, we integrate character
building and the learning of values, social emotional competencies and
skills in all our CCA through well-planned and comprehensive CCA plans.</p>
<p>In line with the School’s Desired Culture of Care and to promote the “Kampung
Spirit”, we also aim to build camaraderie among students from diverse backgrounds
through interactions during CCA sessions. By learning and interacting with
one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging
to the school and community.</p>
