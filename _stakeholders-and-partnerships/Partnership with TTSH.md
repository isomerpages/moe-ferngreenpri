# Partnership with TTSH


The school took part in TTSH’s Project Hong Bao fundraising activity this Lunar New Year. Our children created and decorated their red packets and penned messages of encouragement to the needy patients, many of whom are the elderly sick. They also donated some of their Hong Bao money. Together with Parents and staff, the school raised a total of <b>$2010.60</b>!
