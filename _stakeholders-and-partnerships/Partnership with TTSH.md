# Partnership with TTSH


The school took part in TTSH’s Project Hong Bao fundraising activity this Lunar New Year. Our children created and decorated their red packets and penned messages of encouragement to the needy patients, many of whom are the elderly sick. They also donated some of their Hong Bao money. Together with Parents and staff, the school raised a total of <b>$2010.60</b>!

To instill the value of Care in our students, the school collaborated with Tan Tock Seng Hospital to commemorate Nurses Day this year. Nurses play an important role in caring for patients and ensuring that they are well supported during the recovery process. For the Nurses' Day on 1 August, our students will learn about what nurses do and how they are so important in Patients’ recovery process. The children will also design a card and pen down notes of appreciation to appreciate the efforts of our nurses.
