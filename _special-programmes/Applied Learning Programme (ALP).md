<h5><strong>FGPS Maker Education</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Making</strong>&nbsp;is an interesting and brain stimulating way
to introduce students to the STEM subjects. It is an iterative process
of tinkering and problem solving that draws on a DIY mindset. Making is
collaborative and allows for self-expression through the creation of a
personally meaningful artefact that is shared with a larger community.
Making also stresses on the notion of "failing forward", equipping students
with the mental resilience to recover from repeated failures while engaging
them in the joy of learning.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>FGPS Maker Education ALP</strong>&nbsp;aims to trigger
Students’ interest in STEM by exposing them to engaging projects that will
enable them to use everyday materials and STEM concepts to design and build
solutions to address problems. With the Maker Education ALP, we hope to
equip our students with 21st century competencies, hone their critical
and inventive thinking skills, and foster innovation and develop their
ability to identify and solve problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>FGPS Maker Education ALP</strong>&nbsp;will take on a
3-tier learning structure &amp; progressive skill training framework as
depicted below:</p>

<p><strong>Curriculum Infusion:</strong>
<br>By weaving in the concept of Making into the main school curriculum. All
IP subjects will have opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding
of concepts learnt, by creating meaningful artefacts that demonstrate how
such concepts operates in real-life.

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Supporting school’s learning direction of “Learning by Doing”:</strong>
<br>· Creating opportunities and compliment lesson delivery that involves
students in creating tools for learning, evidences of learning, extension
of learning.
<br>· Enabling submission of artefacts as alternative representation of learning
efforts.
<br>· Employing opportunities in the form of extended work submission, termly
assignment, and/or undertaking of interdisciplinary project work.
