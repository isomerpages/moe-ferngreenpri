<h5><strong>FGPS Maker Education</strong></h5>
<p>Making is an interesting and brain stimulating way to introduce students
to the STEM subjects. It is an iterative process of tinkering and problem
solving that draws on a DIY mindset. Making is collaborative and allows
for self-expression through the creation of a personally meaningful artefact
that is shared with a larger community. Making also stresses on the notion
of "failing forward", equipping students with the mental resilience to
recover from repeated failures while engaging them in the joy of learning.</p>
<p>The <strong>FGPS Maker Education</strong> aims to trigger Students’ interest
in STEM by exposing them to engaging projects that will enable them to
use everyday materials and STEM concepts to design and build solutions
to address problems. With the Maker Education ALP, we hope to equip our
students with 21st century competencies, hone their critical and inventive
thinking skills, and foster innovation and develop their ability to identify
and solve problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>FGPS Maker Education </strong>will take on a 3-tier learning
structure &amp; progressive skill training framework as depicted below:</p>
