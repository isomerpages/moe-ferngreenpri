<p>The TIE Programme aims to develop our students with the 21 Century Competencies
of Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills which will enable them to
develop cultural sensitivities. It exposes students to Asia with a greater
focus on ASEAN countries and sensitises them to the place of Singapore
in the world. It also helps to strengthen studentsâ€™ commitment and rootedness
to Singapore.</p>
