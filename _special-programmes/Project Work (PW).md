# PROJECT WORK (PW)

AN OVERVIEW
-----------

The world today is dynamic and complex. It requires everyone, including young children, to learn continuously, collaboratively, critically, and creatively. This means that our students would need to connect their learning in various subjects to solve novel problems, develop attributes that would enable them to work collaboratively with peers, and nurture an enduring love for observing, inquiring, exploring, and reflecting. Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) provides opportunities for the students to do just that.

OUR APPROACH
------------

In Fern Green, our approach to Project Work is anchored by the Inquiry-based Learning, where students’ learning is guided by asking questions and researching for answers. These will help them make connections with their prior knowledge, synthesize their learning from the various subject disciplines, and build new knowledge. Students will work collaboratively to learn by doing in Makers and Outdoors Education, and be provided with opportunities to reflect on their learning process. Students would also be provided with opportunities to leverage the affordances of technology to learn, research, and/or reflect at home.

PROJECT THEMES
--------------

In line with our school’s eco-commitment to an urgent global emergency of climate change, the themes for the project work across the years will be nested in the overarching theme of “Conservation and Biodiversity”.  We hope that this would allow our children the space to begin to discern the desired course of human action for our generations to come, and inspire them to take the first step towards advocating for the change they would like to see.   
  

OUR STUDENTS’ WORK
------------------

In 2021 Primary 3 IPW, students were tasked to create a 3D Infographic to raise awareness of the importance of conservation of their ‘adopted’ endangered animal. To inculcate the importance of upcycling to conserve our scarce resources, this infographic should be made using recycled materials and have a functional use (e.g., can be used as a pencil holder). Here are some samples of students’ work.
