# PROJECT WORK (PW)

AN OVERVIEW
-----------

The world today is dynamic and complex. It requires everyone, including young children, to learn continuously, collaboratively, critically, and creatively. This means that our students would need to connect their learning in various subjects to solve novel problems, develop attributes that would enable them to work collaboratively with peers, and nurture an enduring love for observing, inquiring, exploring, and reflecting. Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) provides opportunities for the students to do just that.

OUR APPROACH
------------

In Fern Green, our approach to Project Work is anchored by the Inquiry-based Learning, where studentsâ€™ learning is guided by asking questions and researching for answers. These will help them make connections with their prior knowledge, synthesize their learning from the various subject disciplines, and build new knowledge. Students will work collaboratively to learn by doing in Makers and Outdoors Education, and be provided with opportunities to reflect on their learning process. Students would also be provided with opportunities to leverage the affordances of technology to learn, research, and/or reflect at home.
