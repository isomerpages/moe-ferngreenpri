<h4><strong>An Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The world today is dynamic and complex. It requires everyone, including
young children, to learn continuously, collaboratively, critically, and
creatively. This means that our students would need to connect their learning
in various subjects to solve novel problems, develop attributes that would
enable them to work collaboratively with peers, and nurture an enduring
love for observing, inquiring, exploring, and reflecting. Project Work
(PW) provides opportunities for the students to do just that.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>In Fern Green, our approach to Project Work is anchored by the Inquiry-based
Learning, where students’ learning is guided by asking questions and researching
for answers. These will help them make connections with their prior knowledge,
synthesize their learning from the various subject disciplines, and build
new knowledge. Students will work collaboratively to learn by doing in
Makers and Outdoors Education, and be provided with opportunities to reflect
on their learning process. Students would also be provided with opportunities
to leverage the affordances of technology to learn, research, and/or reflect
at home.</p>

<h4><strong>Project Themes</strong></h4>
<p>In line with our school’s eco-commitment to an urgent global emergency
of climate change, the themes for the project work across the years will
be nested in the overarching theme of “Conservation and Biodiversity”.&nbsp;
We hope that this would allow our children the space to begin to discern
the desired course of human action for our generations to come, and inspire
them to take the first step towards advocating for the change they would
like to see.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Students' Work</strong></h4>
<p>In Primary 3 PW, students were tasked to create a 3D Infographic to raise
awareness of the importance of conservation of their ‘adopted’ endangered
animal. To inculcate the importance of upcycling to conserve our scarce
resources, this infographic should be made using recycled materials and
have a functional use (e.g., can be used as a pencil holder).&nbsp;Here
are some samples of students’ work.</p>
