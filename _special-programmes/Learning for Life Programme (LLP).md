# LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP)

The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) ‘**Get REAL!@FGPS**’ serves to equip all students with the essential life skills or 21CC and the social emotional competencies via a suite of programmes targeting at building the necessary social emotional competencies in our future leaders and advocates. This will also be done in alignment with the R3ICH values at the core of the 21CC framework to ensure students do not seek only to excel in their chosen fields, but are also motivated to serve and lead others. This is also in alignment with the School Core Values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, Harmony), and the desired School Culture of Care and Discipline anchored on trust and quality relationships.
