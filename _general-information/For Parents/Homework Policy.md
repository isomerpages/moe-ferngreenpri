<p>There are 3 broad Categories of Homework that Teachers may assign to students.
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Practice Exercises which aim to help students to reinforce, recall and
practise newly acquired skills or concepts&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparatory Homework which requires students to source for and read background
information to prepare them for future lessons on a specific topic or subject.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension Homework which encourages students to pursue knowledge individually
and imaginatively. It may include writing a book review, painting a picture,
doing a research, or retrieving information from the internet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When assigning homework, Teachers in Fern Green Primary School (FGPS)
adhere to the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homework that is assigned must be regular (not necessarily daily)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homework that is set should be appropriate for the students’ age and ability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homework set should be challenging and purposeful, but not so demanding
that it has adverse effects on the students’ motivation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homework assignment needs to take into account students’ other commitments
such as involvement in CCA and afternoon classes</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that time for learning of Spelling and Dictation has not been
factored into the timing as students are provided with spelling lists for
early preparation.</p>
<p>To protect family time, minimal homework will be set for completion during
School and Public Holidays during term time.</p>
