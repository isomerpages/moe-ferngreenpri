<h4><strong>Onboarding</strong></h4>
<p>Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed
by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with schools, receive
information and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving
consent for school trips.</p>
<p>The school would like to invite parents to download the Parents Gateway
mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms
only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process. Please refer to&nbsp;<strong>Annex A</strong>&nbsp;below
for a step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>From May 2019, parents who are onboard Parents Gateway will receive information
via the mobile app. The school will continue to issue hardcopy letters
to parents who are unable to come onboard Parents Gateway.</p>
