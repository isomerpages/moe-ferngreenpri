# Homework Policy

There are 3 broad Categories of Homework that Teachers may assign to students. These are:  

*   Practice Exercises which aim to help students to reinforce, recall and practise newly acquired skills or concepts   
    
*   Preparatory Homework which requires students to source for and read background information to prepare them for future lessons on a specific topic or subject.   
    
*   Extension Homework which encourages students to pursue knowledge individually and imaginatively. It may include writing a book review, painting a picture, doing a research, or retrieving information from the internet  
    

When assigning homework, Teachers in Fern Green Primary School (FGPS) adhere to the following principles:

*   Homework that is assigned must be regular (not necessarily daily)  
    
*   Homework that is set should be appropriate for the students’ age and ability  
    
*   Homework set should be challenging and purposeful, but not so demanding that it has adverse effects on the students’ motivation  
    
*   Homework assignment needs to take into account students’ other commitments such as involvement in CCA and afternoon classes
