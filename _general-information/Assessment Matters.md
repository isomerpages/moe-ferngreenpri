<h4><strong>Our Assessment Beliefs</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that every child wants to and can learn. When students see
meaning in what they learn, they become more motivated, challenged, and
inspired to develop a passion for learning. Therefore, learning goals are
shared with them to encourage ownership of their learning process.</p>
<p>Assessment is integral to the teaching and learning process. Teaching,
learning, and assessment experiences are designed to support student learning
and foster the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC). We design
assessments with clarity of purpose to gather evidence of our students’
progress and to provide timely and targeted feedback. The feedback empowers
our students to make sense of their learning and to move their learning
forward. Through varied forms of assessment, students are guided to reflect,
make sense of the feedback, and chart their own learning progress.</p>
<p>A well-balanced assessment system incorporates both summative and formative
assessments. Relying solely on summative assessment can result in teaching
that is overly driven by testing, limiting meaningful learning opportunities
and potentially diminishing students’ motivation to learn. While it is
important to determine a student’s level of competence at specific points
in their learning journey, it is equally crucial to continuously monitor
their progress and actively involve them in peer and self-assessment.</p>
