### The President's Award for Teachers (PAT) and the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) 2024 
Every year, Presidentâ€™s Award for Teachers (PAT) and the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) are given out to teachers in Singapore to recognise their professional excellence. Both PAT and OYEA are national awards.

PAT pays tribute to experienced teachers for their role in moulding the future of our nation. These teachers are role models for the teaching profession as they demonstrate a deep passion for teaching, and they inspire both their students and peers through their words and deeds.

These teachers personify youthful idealism, energy and enthusiasm, and inspire both their students and peers through their words and deeds. Educators born on or after 30 June 1989 are eligible for the award.

### Say It From Your Heart @FGPS
Dear Parents, Guardians &amp; Partners,&nbsp; 

As we work closely together to support our children, there could be times where a staff member would go the extra mile and make someone's day, and you hope you could express your thoughts and/or appreciation and 'say it from your heart'.&nbsp;

We hope to leverage this platform to allow all to do just that! Please share with us [here](https://go.gov.sg/sayitfromyourheart) if any of our staff members have made an impression during their interactions with you, so we could affirm their efforts and encourage them on!&nbsp; 

Thank you in advance for your time!
