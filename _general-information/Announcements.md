### Say It From Your Heart @FGPS
Dear Parents, Guardians &amp; Partners,&nbsp; 

As we work closely together to support our children, there could be times where a staff member would go the extra mile and make someone's day, and you hope you could express your thoughts and/or appreciation and 'say it from your heart'.&nbsp;

We hope to leverage this platform to allow all to do just that! Please share with us [here](https://go.gov.sg/sayitfromyourheart) if any of our staff members have made an impression during their interactions with you, so we could affirm their efforts and encourage them on!&nbsp; 

Thank you in advance for your time!
