<h3><strong>Say It From Your Heart @FGPS</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Parents, Guardians &amp; Partners,&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we work closely together to support our children, there could be times
where a staff member would go the extra mile and make someone's day, and
you hope you could express your thoughts and/or appreciation and 'say it
from your heart'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope to leverage this platform to allow all to do just that! Please
share with us <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sayitfromyourheart" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> if
any of our staff members have made an impression during their interactions
with you, so we could affirm their efforts and encourage them on!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your time!</p>
