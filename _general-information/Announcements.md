### Say It From Your Heart @FGPS
Dear Parents, Guardians &amp; Partners,&nbsp; 

As we work closely together to support our children, there could be times where a staff member would go the extra mile and make someone's day, and you hope you could express your thoughts and/or appreciation and 'say it from your heart'.&nbsp;

We hope to leverage this platform to allow all to do just that! Please share with us [here](https://go.gov.sg/sayitfromyourheart) if any of our staff members have made an impression during their interactions with you, so we could affirm their efforts and encourage them on!&nbsp; 

Thank you in advance for your time!

#### Revised Income Eligibility Criteria for Priority Order 1 Registrants

From the 2023 MK Registration Exercise, the income cap to be eligible for Priority Order 1 registrants will be raised in view of rising income levels. To ensure that MKs remain accessible to children from lower-income households, one-third of MK K1 places will be reserved for Singapore Citizens (SCs) from households who live within 1km of the kindergarten with Gross Household Income (GHI) not exceeding $4,500 per month, or Per Capita Income (PCI) not exceeding $1,125 per month. SCs from these eligible households would be admitted to MKs under Priority Order 1.

For more information on the Priority Order for admission to MK, parents may visit this [link](https://www.moe.gov.sg/preschool/moe-kindergarten/register/priority-admission).

#### Details of 2023 MK Registration Exercise

The 2023 MK Registration Exercise is open to SC and Permanent Resident (PR) children born between 2 January 2019 and 1 January 2020, both dates inclusive. Parents can register their child for admission to an MK via the [MK website](www.moe.gov.sg/mk), from 9am on 17 February 2023 to 4pm on 21 February 2023. Parents will be informed of the registration outcome by 14 April 2023. Outside this registration period, parents can seek admission to K1 or K2 for their child by contacting the MK directly to check if there are vacancies.

#### 2023 MK Open House

The 55 MKs participating in the 2023 MK Registration Exercise will hold their open houses on either 11 or 18 February 2023. Parents are encouraged to visit and learn more about each individual MK’s curriculum, programmes, interactive learning environment and facilities as well as speak to the MK Educators. The open houses will allow parents to better understand the MKs before registering their child in their preferred MKs.
